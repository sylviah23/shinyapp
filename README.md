Shinyapp made for the Nowak Lab: https://sjh326.shinyapps.io/wound_healing_pipeline/

This Shinyapp allows users to upload a set of images and will then splice up their file names into different columns as needed. The user will then be able to download a csv of the spliced up file names. A demo of this is shown below.
